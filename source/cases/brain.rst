        Developing drugs is a very tedious process that involves rigor testing on animals and on humans.
        While treatment effect for most of the cases can be relatively easy quantified, brain activity is a challenge.

        Measuring qualitative activity of human brain is a very non trivial task.
        It is only possible to get indirect measurement of what is treated and patients participate in a game that involves certain brain activities.
        In PyMC Labs I helped to create the model and a packaged solution to estimate the latent property of brain activity.
        The Bayesian model allowed to compile indirect measurements to inform about drug efficiency.
