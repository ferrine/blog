"AB Testing is a very common hypothesis testing technique in many "
"companies. Bayesian AB testing is not a new but rarely used approach to a"
" classical problem. Unlike traditional, Frequentist, approach, it enables"

"Bayesian AB Testing is about qualitative answers to the same questions. "
"So instead of \"is there an effect\", you can say \"what is the effect\"."
" While this sounds similar, the latter enables to go beyond and do "
"decision-making with money in mind. You can plug Bayesian posterior into "
"a financial model that translates to money language. Find more from the "
