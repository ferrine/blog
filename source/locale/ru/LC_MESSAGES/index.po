#~ "Developing drugs is a very tedious "
#~ "process that involves rigor testing on"
#~ " animals and on humans. While "
#~ "treatment effect for most of the "
#~ "cases can be relatively easy quantified,"
#~ " brain activity is a challenge. "
#~ "Measuring qualitative activity of human "
#~ "brain is a very non trivial task."
#~ " It is only possible to get "
#~ "indirect measurement of what is treated"
#~ " and patients participate in a game"
#~ " that involves certain brain activities."
#~ " In PyMC Labs I helped to "
#~ "create the model and a packaged "

#~ "AB Testing is a very common "
#~ "hypothesis testing technique in many "
#~ "companies. Bayesian AB testing is not"
#~ " a new but rarely used approach "
#~ "to a classical problem. Unlike "
#~ "traditional, Frequentist, approach, it enables"
#~ " more than qualitative decisions. Bayesian"
#~ " AB Testing is about qualitative "
#~ "answers to the same questions. So "
#~ "instead of \"is there an effect\", "
#~ "you can say \"what is the "
#~ "effect\". While this sounds similar, the"
#~ " latter enables to go beyond and "
#~ "do decision making with money in "
#~ "mind. You can plug Bayesian posterior"
#~ " into a financial model that "
#~ "translates to money language. Find more"

#~ "Molecules are everywhere. Sometimes you "
#~ "need to figure out what a specific"
#~ " molecule is. There are numerous "
#~ "approaches to infer the molecule "
#~ "structure. One of them deals with "
#~ "a sequential procedure which is observed"
#~ " at every step with a lot of"
#~ " noise. The beauty is that this "
#~ "approach is cheap and scalable. The "
#~ "approach involves inference on the "
#~ "unobserved part of the experiment which"
#~ " generates the noisy observation. After "
#~ "understanding the latent process model "
#~ "Bayesian inference allowed to overcome "
#~ "influence of noise. In the project "
#~ "I developed parameter recovery study to"

#~ " benefits in marketing analytics, "
#~ "particularly when assessing channel "
#~ "effectiveness: Bayesian models can incorporate"
#~ " prior knowledge and adapt to new "
#~ "data, making them suitable for analyzing"
#~ " complex and dynamic marketing "
#~ "environments. By accounting for uncertainty,"
#~ " Bayesian models provide more reliable "
#~ "and stable estimates, aiding in "
#~ "better-informed decision-making. Bayesian "
#~ "models can handle sparse or small "
#~ "datasets, enabling accurate analysis even "
#~ "with limited data. You can estimate "
#~ "individual channel impacts, allowing for "
#~ "tailored optimization of marketing efforts "
#~ "and budget allocation. As new data "
