"Developing drugs is a very tedious process that involves rigor testing on"
" animals and on humans. While treatment effect for most of the cases can "
"be relatively easy quantified, brain activity is a challenge."

"Measuring qualitative activity of human brain is a very non trivial task."
" It is only possible to get indirect measurement of what is treated and "
"patients participate in a game that involves certain brain activities. In"
" PyMC Labs I helped to create the model and a packaged solution to "
"estimate the latent property of brain activity. The Bayesian model "
"allowed to compile indirect measurements to inform about drug efficiency."
