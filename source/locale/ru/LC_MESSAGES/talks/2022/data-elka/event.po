"I talk about the Bayesian approach to AB testing. The approach consists "
"of 3 steps: making a hypothesis about the experiment, understanding time "
"and data constraints, and interpreting the results after collecting the "
"data. The advantage is that the Bayesian AB(C) test does not require "
"p-values, corrections or bootstrap procedures, is conservative (does not "
"exaggerate the result on small data) and is easily interpreted for "
"business."
