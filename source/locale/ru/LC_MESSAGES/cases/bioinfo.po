"Molecules are everywhere. Sometimes you need to figure out what a "
"specific molecule is. There are numerous approaches to infer the molecule"
" structure. One of them deals with a sequential procedure which is "
"observed at every step with a lot of noise. The beauty is that this "
"approach is cheap and scalable."

"The approach involves inference on the unobserved part of the experiment "
"which generates the noisy observation. After understanding the latent "
"process model Bayesian inference allowed to overcome influence of noise. "
"In the project I developed parameter recovery study to understand which "
"parts of the process are possible to control and which are not."
