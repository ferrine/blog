    I talk about the Bayesian approach to AB testing.
    The approach consists of 3 steps: making a hypothesis about the experiment,
    understanding time and data constraints, and interpreting the results after
    collecting the data. The advantage is that the Bayesian AB(C) test does not
    require p-values, corrections or bootstrap procedures, is conservative
    (does not exaggerate the result on small data) and is easily interpreted for business.
