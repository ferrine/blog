About me
========

Projects
--------

Neuroscience
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Neuroscience backed model to quantify treatment effect on human brain for a *Pharmaceutical company*. 
Using a Bayesian model it became possible to work on scarce experimental data and quantify brain activity metrics from an interactive game.

AB Testing
~~~~~~~~~~
Multiple AB testing projects evolved into a principled way to establish priors, plan the experiment and interpret the results. 
I've included this knowledge into my Practical Bayes course and gave a talk at the :xref:`ODS workshop <talks:2022:data-elka>`.

Bioengineering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Bioengineering project to understand molecules structure. The main challenge is temporal nature of noisy observations. 
The model had to infer the :xref:`wiki:hmm` structure from hundreds of noisy time series. 
Classical machine learning had failed to take in account the structured solution.

Other
~~~~~
Other projects include marketing mix model, chemistry multilevel models and knowledge transfer between past and current experiments.


Teaching
--------

I'm an :xref:`invited lecturer <talks:2022:msu-practical-bayes>` at Moscow State University since 2022.

Experience
----------
* Bayesian deep learning research at :xref:`misc:bayesgroup` 2017-2020
* Large scale computer vision and distributed deep learning for collaborative environments
* Strong Python, Linux and CI/CD experience
