   .. card:: Is your problem **white box**?

      If your problem is not white box it makes little sense to use Bayesian methods.
      The approach relies on clear understanding and reasoning about the problem.

   .. card:: How much do you know about the problem?

      The more you understand about the model and process it describes the better is the solution.
      No traditional approach takes this to the absolute and translates expert opinions to rigor definition.

   .. card:: Do you understand causal relations of your problem?

      Understanding relations is a half-way to build a Bayesian model.
      Ignoring these relations leads to biased estimates and decisions.
