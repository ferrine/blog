    I talk about how Bayesian AB testing can drive conclusions from data.
    There is always the whole pipeline of decision making process: panning, execution and delivery.
    Each of the stages benefits from domain knowledge about the experimental setting.
    In the talk I explain how this can be framed from a Bayesian perspective.
