Brain Activity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Developing drugs is a very tedious process that involves rigor testing on animals and on humans.
While treatment effect for most of the cases can be relatively easy quantified, brain activity is a challenge.
Measuring qualitative activity of human brain is a very non trivial task.
It is only possible to get indirect measurement of what is treated and patients participate in a game that involves certain brain activities.
In PyMC Labs I helped to create the model and a packaged solution to estimate the latent property of brain activity.
The Bayesian model allowed to compile indirect measurements to inform about drug efficiency.


AB Testing
~~~~~~~~~~
AB Testing is a very common hypothesis testing technique in many companies.
Bayesian AB testing is not a new but rarely used approach to a classical problem.
Unlike traditional, Frequentist, approach, it enables more than qualitative decisions.
Bayesian AB Testing is about qualitative answers to the same questions.
So instead of "is there an effect", you can say "what is the effect".
While this sounds similar, the latter enables to go beyond and do decision making with money in mind.
You can plug Bayesian posterior into a financial model that translates to money language.

Bioinformatics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Molecules are everywhere.
Sometimes you need to figure out what a specific molecule is.
There are numerous approaches to infer the molecule structure.
One of them deals with a sequential procedure which is observed at every step with a lot of noise.
The beauty is that this approach is cheap and scalable.
The approach involves inference on the unobserved part of the experiment which generates the noisy observation.
After understanding the latent process model Bayesian inference allowed to overcome influence of noise.
In the project I developed parameter recovery study to understand which parts of the process are possible to control and which are not.

Media Mix Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Media Mix Models are analytical tools used to optimize marketing strategies by measuring the effectiveness of various marketing channels.
They help in determining the best combination of channels to maximize ROI, drive customer engagement, and allocate budget effectively.
Bayesian Inference offers several benefits in marketing analytics, particularly when assessing channel effectiveness:
Bayesian models can incorporate prior knowledge and adapt to new data, making them suitable for analyzing complex and dynamic marketing environments.
By accounting for uncertainty, Bayesian models provide more reliable and stable estimates, aiding in better-informed decision-making.
Bayesian models can handle sparse or small datasets, enabling accurate analysis even with limited data.
You can estimate individual channel impacts, allowing for tailored optimization of marketing efforts and budget allocation.
As new data becomes available, Bayesian models can be updated easily, allowing marketers to stay current with evolving trends and make timely adjustments to their strategies.


Chemistry
~~~~~~~~~
Chemistry is a very structured domain where there are either a lot of experimental data and knowledge available.
Unfortunately, not all cases are such.
There are real world scenarios where data is scarce and expensive.
Predictions are not the holy grail when you want to optimize the production process.
Characteristics of the process are the ones that are of the most interest.
Bayesian approach allows to get insights from scarce data, and conclude on relations strength driving informed data driven decision making.
