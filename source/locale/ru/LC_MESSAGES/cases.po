"AB Testing is a very common hypothesis testing technique in many "
"companies. Bayesian AB testing is not a new but rarely used approach to a"
" classical problem. Unlike traditional, Frequentist, approach, it enables"
" more than qualitative decisions."

"Bayesian AB Testing is about qualitative answers to the same questions. "
"So instead of \"is there an effect\", you can say \"what is the effect\"."
" While this sounds similar, the latter enables to go beyond and do "
"decision making with money in mind. You can plug Bayesian posterior into "
"a financial model that translates to money language. Find more from the "
":doc:`ODS workshop </talks/2022/data-elka/event>`."

"Molecules are everywhere. Sometimes you need to figure out what a "
"specific molecule is. There are numerous approaches to infer the molecule"
" structure. One of them deals with a sequential procedure which is "
"observed at every step with a lot of noise. The beauty is that this "
"approach is cheap and scalable."

"The approach involves inference on the unobserved part of the experiment "
"which generates the noisy observation. After understanding the latent "
"process model Bayesian inference allowed to overcome influence of noise. "
"In the project I developed parameter recovery study to understand which "
"parts of the process are possible to control and which are not."

"Developing drugs is a very tedious process that involves rigor testing on"

"Measuring qualitative activity of human brain is a very non trivial task."
" It is only possible to get indirect measurement of what is treated and "
"patients participate in a game that involves certain brain activities. In"
" PyMC Labs I helped to create the model and a packaged solution to "
"estimate the latent property of brain activity. The Bayesian model "
"allowed to compile indirect measurements to inform about drug efficiency."

"Predictions are not the holy grail when you want to optimize the "
"production process. Characteristics of the process are the ones that are "
"of the most interest. Bayesian approach allows to get insights from "
"scarce data, and conclude on relations strength driving informed data "

"Media Mix Models are analytical tools used to optimize marketing "
"strategies by measuring the effectiveness of various marketing channels. "
"They help in determining the best combination of channels to maximize "
"ROI, drive customer engagement, and allocate budget effectively. Bayesian"
" Inference offers several benefits in marketing analytics, particularly "
"when assessing channel effectiveness: Bayesian models can incorporate "
"prior knowledge and adapt to new data, making them suitable for analyzing"
" complex and dynamic marketing environments."

"By accounting for uncertainty, Bayesian models provide more reliable and "
"stable estimates, aiding in better-informed decision-making. Bayesian "
"models can handle sparse or small datasets, enabling accurate analysis "
"even with limited data. You can estimate individual channel impacts, "
"allowing for tailored optimization of marketing efforts and budget "
"allocation. As new data becomes available, Bayesian models can be updated"
" easily, allowing marketers to stay current with evolving trends and make"
" timely adjustments to their strategies."
