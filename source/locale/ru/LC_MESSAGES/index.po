msgid ""
"If your problem is not white box it makes little sense to use Bayesian "
"methods. The approach relies on clear understanding and reasoning about "
"the problem."

msgid "How much do you know about the problem?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/index.rst:67
msgid ""
"The more you understand about the model and process it describes the "
"better is the solution. No traditional approach takes this to the "
"absolute and translates expert opinions to rigor definition."

msgid "Do you understand causal relations of your problem?"

msgid ""
"Understanding relations is a half-way to build a Bayesian model. Ignoring"
" these relations leads to biased estimates and decisions."

msgid "Do you need to interpret the solution?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/index.rst:80
msgid ""
"Clear interpretation is the core principle in Bayesian modeling. Every "
"unknown parameter in the model is estimated using expert and data "
"guidance. Using Bayesian approach you make maximum use of human in the "
"loop data driven business processes."

msgid "Do you need just predictions or something more?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/index.rst:86
msgid ""
"If predictions is all you care about, I suggest looking into :xref:`misc"
":conformal-prediction`. It helps to take in account uncertainty for the "
"prediction tasks. If this does not help, and you need uncertainty in "
"model interpretation for your decision process, Bayesian approach is for "
"you."
